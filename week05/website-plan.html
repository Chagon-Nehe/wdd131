    <div class="section">
        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p>The site name is **Nutri-Health Quest**.</p>
        <p>I chose this name because it positions healthy living as a fun adventure or quest. The name is memorable, positive, and kid-friendly, which fits the target audience of families with children who will use the health tracking tools.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to serve as a gamified platform for families to track their daily healthy habits, such as drinking water, eating fruits and vegetables, and exercising. The site will provide motivational content, track progress, and offer fun, achievable weekly challenges. It will be a simple, dynamic web application designed to make healthy choices a rewarding and engaging experience for both parents and children.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>**Scenario 1:** A parent wants to track their family's water intake for the day. They need to easily add a glass of water for each family member and see their combined progress toward a daily goal.</li>
            <li>**Scenario 2:** A child is looking for a fun new activity. They visit the site and check the "Weekly Challenge" section to find a suggestion for a new game or recipe.</li>
            <li>**Scenario 3:** A user wants to find new, simple tips for encouraging their child to eat more vegetables. They navigate to the "Tips" section and filter content by "Nutrition."</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Color Schema</h2>
        <p>I will use a natural, energetic color palette to evoke feelings of health and vitality. The colors will be applied as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Primary Color:</b> #38761D (Forest Green) - Used for major headings (H1, H2), and borders.</li>
            <li><b>Secondary Color: </b>#65B741 (Vibrant Green) - Used for call-to-action buttons, active links, and accent elements.</li>
            <li><b>Accent Color:</b> #F8F4E1 (Cream) - The main background color for the page, providing a soft and inviting feel.</li>
            <li><b>Text Color:</b> #333333 (Dark Gray) - For all body text and paragraphs to ensure high readability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This document is styled using this color scheme.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>I have selected two fonts to create a clean, modern, and readable design:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Headings:</b> `'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif` - This font is slightly narrow and bold, making it perfect for titles and headings that need to stand out.</li>
            <li><b>Body Text:</b> `'Roboto', sans-serif` - A highly readable, clean, and classic font that works well for paragraphs and all other text.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These fonts are implemented on this document to demonstrate their usage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>Here are the simple wireframes for the home page, representing the mobile and desktop views.</p>
